There is no charge for the use of the computers. A charge of 25 cents per page, after 20 pages it will be 10 cents each and 50 cents for full color page. Same price for copies. All files you wish to save must be saved to a memory stick, disk or chip. As of now, there is no restriction on how long you use a computer, as long as no one else is waiting. If there is a waiting line, you must finish your session within 30 minutes. We are CIPA compliant. 

### Library Netiquette: 
"Netiquette" is short for "Internet etiquette". Like everyday etiquette, it is based on respect for the rights of others, in this case, the library, its equipment, and its other users. Besides following the Computer Guidelines above, this means that you do nothing that might offend other users of the library or of the computers. For instance, you do not call up sites with explicit sexual references or graphics. And if you should accidently get onto such a site, you get out of it right away (Clicking on <BACK> on the tool bar at the top is the fastest way).
