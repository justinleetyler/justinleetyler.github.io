### Library Netiquette: 
"Netiquette" is short for "Internet etiquette". Like everyday etiquette, it is based on respect for the rights of others, in this case, the library, its equipment, and its other users. Besides following the Computer Guidelines above, this means that you do nothing that might offend other users of the library or of the computers. For instance, you do not call up sites with explicit sexual references or graphics. And if you should accidently get onto such a site, you get out of it right away (Clicking on <BACK> on the tool bar at the top is the fastest way).
