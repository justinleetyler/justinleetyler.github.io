Daily devotions from the Bible

In the morning

*From Psalm 51*

Tune me in to foot-tapping songs,
  set these once-broken bones to dancing.
God, make a fresh start in me,
  shape a Genesis week from the chaos of my life.
Don’t throw me out with the trash,
  or fail to breathe holiness in me.
Bring me back from gray exile,
  put a fresh wind in my sails!

What a God we have! And how fortunate we are to have him, this Father of our Master Jesus! Because Jesus was raised from the dead, we’ve been given a brand-new life and have everything to live for. Pet. 1.3

You who serve God, praise God!
  Just to speak his name is praise!
Just to remember God is a blessing—

  keep lifting all your praises to God!

4-9 God is higher than anything and anyone,
    outshining everything you can see in the skies.

Remember, our Message is not about ourselves; we’re proclaiming Jesus Christ, the Master. All we are is messengers, errand runners from Jesus for you. It started when God said, “Light up the darkness!” and our lives filled up with light as we saw and understood God in the face of Christ, all bright and beautiful. 2 Corinthians 4:5-6

*Prayers may be offered for ourselfs and others.*

*The Lord's Prayer*

Reveal who you are.

Do what's best-
  as above, so below.
Keep us alive with three square meals.
Keep us forgiven with you and forgiving others.
Keep us safe from ourselves and the Devil.
You're in charge!
You can do anything you want!
You’re ablaze in beauty!

At the Close of Day
---
*From Psalm 134*

Come, bless God,
  all you servants of God!
You priests of God, posted to the nightwatch
  in God’s shrine,
Lift your praising hands to the Holy Place,
  and bless God.
In turn, may God of Zion bless you—
  God who made heaven and earth!
    
*A reading*

But God, you are, in fact, here, here with us!
    You know who we are—you named us!
    Don’t leave us without a leg to stand on.
Jeremiah 14:9

*The following may be said*

Lord, you now have set your servant free / to go in peace as you have promised / For these eyes of mine have seen the Savior / whom you have prepared for all the world to see / A Light to enlighten the nations / and the glory of your people Israel.

sins, be included.*
