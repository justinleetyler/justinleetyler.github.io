> The trouble is that information doesn't nourish us. Worse, in the end, it turns out to be boring. -q -- Knowledge has a point when we start to find and make connections, to weave stories out of it, stories through which we make sense of the world and our place within it. -q -- And if there is an antidote to boredom, it is not information but meaning. -q

> ... Civilization and its discontents... Freud's thesis is that the growth of civilization required man to deny expression to many of his most basic instincts, which accordingly turned inward and found their expression in various neuroses and mental conflicts. -p. 149 -q
> Christianity was thus the greater leveler, a harbinger of the 'herd mentality' that Nietzsche condemns in democracy and socialism. -p. 149 -q
> ... Christanity
> which Nietzsche called Platonism for the people... -p. 152 -q
> Ultimately, the only way to overcome nihilism is to embrace the loss of any fixed point of reference. Bereft of all certainties, man must rely upon his own will to create goals and values for himself that will give meaning to his life. He must learn to will, to want, and to love. -p. 155 -q

> The contents [of BEING AND TIME] would have given her [Heidegger's mother] little consolation; the book argues that confronting the nothingness and inevitability of death is what gives authenticity to life. -p. 206 -q
> Heidegger wants to recapture a sense of wonder and astonishment at the sheer Being of beings, at the fact that there is something rather than nothing. That sense of wonder should not be dissipated in false and nonsensical explanations about the grounds and essence of Being. the fact of existence, in the midst of the possibility of nothingness, is itself what is so astonishing. -p. 211 -q

> It occurs to him [Descartes] that the support beam of almost all our beliefs is the senses. he first muted doubt 9the doubt of the first meditation builds into a kind of intellectual crescendo) is that the senses sometimes deceives us: for instance, we see water on the road, which proves in actuality to be a mirage. -p. 103 -q
> In the beginning stages of human life, we accept the basis of culture on authority. Then, when we go deeper into the ultimate, we find that reason blanks at its sunlight intensity, and we must utilize the mirrors of myth, symbol, and ritual to picture it. Certainly, this usual relationship to the divine still holds to picture it. -p. 116 -q

To be a Christian is to belive any number of paradoxes: that true morality appears in the context of immorality, that god is human, that power is expressed in suffering, and that this human God, uttering the famous cry of abandonment on the cross, is something of an athiest. -p. 135 -q

It took light 2.5 m years to reach earth. 2.5 mya on Earth, 'humans were first discovering the use of tools'.

> The human is the space creatd in the universe process for hearing and celebrating the stories of the universe that fill the universe. -p. 66 -q
> The ancient astronomers, the first cosmologists, and the shamanic storytellers often old their stories at night. The concerns of the day, however important they might seem in the sunlight, usually amount to nothing more than unwelcome distractions in the night when the great story is told in the glow from the fire's embers and Moon's jouney through the branchd shadows of the trees. -p. 68 -q	
> To tell the story of the birthplace of the universe is to tell the story of Eintein... But here is the strange thing. How can I tell the story of the universe without first speaking of Einstein, for he is a fountainhead of the story of the universe as a whole? Einstein can be seen as a power that destroys one world and creates another... No one in the entire world at that time could understand the reality of the Einstein-event. p. 70 -q
> More precisely: galaxies twice as far apart are sailing away from each other twice as fast. Galaxis ten times as far apart sail away ten times as fast... we find an event of cataclysmic energy where all trillion galaxies are brought into a single ineffable point, the birthplace of the universe, the iniial singularity of space-time, the center of the universe. -p. 76 -q
> The idea that the universe began in one place is certainly an ancient one in human history. The image of a birthplace of the universe occurs in the mythical and classical forms of consciousness, and possibly even earlier. -p. 76 -q
> Thus, the scientific discovery [of the beginning of the universe] has this dual nature of being both old [stories of creation] and new [the big bang] simultaneously... The aim is not to eliminate one way of knowing in favor of another; the aim in an ultimate sense is an integral understanding of the universe grounded in both the scientific empirical detail and in our primordial poetic visions of the cosmos. -p. 77 -q
> Instead, I want to remember that humans have a variety of paths to the truth and when these various of paths to the truth and when these various routes arrive at a common consensual knowledge we have he possibility of a story of the universe that can guide us as a whole species as we enter a new millennium. -p. 79 -q

> Her [Melissa] tyical day starts with rising early and spending some quiet time reading or meditating. She then progresses to her puttering phase - listening to the radio 	 while she waters the plants, doing some light housekeeping or sewing,, filing papers or taking care of minor household repairs. After a light breakfast, Melissa might tend the garden or start baking a few loaves of bread, followed by some time on her computer, either writing letters, organizing recipies, or helping out a local charitable organization by entering data on spreadsheets for them. By late morning, melissa takes off on her bicycle to visit family or fiends, go to the library (where she spends time on personal research projects), or run errands. Lunch and dinner are usually simple one-dish affairs made from scratch. She spends her afternoons and evenings either taking care of her friend's daughter or working on whatever I might be interested in [...]. I go to bed fairly early and usually read again until I get tired. It's a low-key life but very satisfying for me.' - p. 192 -q

> Tao means 'The Way.'. The Tao is the Way to live in order to achive by non-doing. -q
> The basic tenets [of Taoism] are four: 1) that the "Way" of Tao underlies all things, 2) that human action that is harmonious with Tao is spontaneous, effortless, and inexhaustible, 3) that the perfected individual is a sage, free from desire and strife, and 4) that the sage conducts government by guiding his people back to a state of harmony with the Tao. -q
> ... shamanism, the aboriginal root of religions. -q
> Therefore the sage goes about doing nothing, teaching no-talking... Creating, yet not posessing, Working, yet not taking credit. Work is done, then forgotten. -q
> The sage stays behind, thus he is ahead. He is detached, thus at one with all. Through selfless action, he attains fulfillment. -q
> In dwelling, be close to the land. In meditation, go deep in the heart. In dealing with others, be gentle and kind. In speech, be true. In ruling, be just. In business, be competent. In action, watch the timing. No fight: No blame. -q

> Therefore the sage takes care of all men and abandons no one. He takes care of all things and abandons nothing. -q
> Therefore the sage avoids extremes, excesses, and complacency. -q
> Weapons are instruments of fear; they are not a wise man's tools. He uses them only when he has no choice. -q
> Tao abides in non-action... and in this way all things would be at peace. -q
> 'A voilent man will die a violent death' This will be the essence of my teaching. -q
> The softest thing in the universe overcomes the hardest thing in the universe. -q
> A content man is never disappointed. -q
> There is no greater sin than desire, no greater curse than discontent, no greater misfortune than wanting something for oneself. Therefore he who knows that enough is enough will always have enough. -q
> The sage has no mind of his own. He is aware of the needs of others. ... The sage is shy and humble - to the world he seems confusing. Men look to him and listen. He behaves like a little child. -q

> Ch.8: This begins with Hain as a foreign office minister. Points include dealing with other government departments, and with civil servants, advocacy for 'complementary' (alternative) medicine (also called 'integrated healthcare' in the book), his rather muted admiration of the queen and royal family (Hains' background is as a republican), unguarded remarks he made to the press about tax policy, and reflections of the state (bad state, according to Hain) of journalism, or investigative journalism. Hain seems to take great pride in actually not taking advice from the civil service, and forcing his will upon officials and departments. This is viewed as true leadership. He also shows distress when the press digs into the politics of a story rather than the story. One wonders what the press is to do. While saying that the press doesn't pay attention to serious, intelligent information and true debate. Yet when they do, Hain says they become part of the story. One also wonders what is virtuous with not listen to what is usually well-informed and cautious advice from his officials. -p. -s

> Mammels have what I call an 'altruistic impulse' in that they respond to signs of distress in others and feel an urge to improve their situation.

> The chimpanzees are the closest. Just 6 million years ago, a single female ape had two daughters. One became the ancestor of all chimpanzees, and the other is our own grandmother. -p. 5 -q
> The more eastern regions of Asia were populated by Homo erectus. 'Upright Man', who survived there for close to 2 million years, making it the most durabe human species ever. This record is unlig\kely to be broken even by our own species. It is douhtful whether Homo sapiens will still be around a thousand years fro nw, so 2 milion years is really out of our leaue. -p. 6 -q
> This unique species, known by scientists as homo floresiensis, reached a maximum height of only 3.5 feet and weighed no more than fifty-five pounds. -p. 7 -q
> In Homo sapiens, the brain accounts for about 2-3 per cent of total body weight, but it consumes 25 percent of the body's enegy when the body is at rest. -p. 9 -q
> Women paid extra. An upright gait eqired hnarrower hips, constricted the birth canal - and this just when babies' heads where getting biger and bigger... Natural selection concsequently favoured earlier births... Human babies are helpless, dependent for many years on their edlers for sustenance, protection and education... It takes a tribe to raise a human. Evolution thus favoured those capable of forming striong social ties. In addition, since humans are born underdeveloped, they can be educated and socialized to a far greater extent than any other animal. -p. 10 -q
> One of the most common uses of early stone tools was to crack open bones in order to get to the marrow. Some researchers believe this was our original niche... This is a key to understanding our history and psychology. -p. 11 -q
> By about 300,000 years ago, Homo erectus, Neanderthals and the freathes of Homo sapiens were using fire on a daily basis... The advent of cooking enabled humans to eat more kinds of food, to devote less time to eating, and to make do with smaller teeth and shorter intestines... When humns domesticated fire, they gained control of an obedient and potentially limitless force. -p. 13 -q
> We don't know exactly where and when animals that can be classified as Homo sapien first evolved from some earlier type of humans, but most scientists agree that by 150,000 years ago, East Africa was populated by Sapins that looked just like us. -p. 14 -q
> Achaeologists have discovered the bones of Neanderthals who lived for many years with severe physical handicaps, evidence that they were cared for by their relatives. -p. 14 -q
> It turned out that 1-4 per cent of the unique human DNA of modern populations in the Middle East and Europe is Neanderthal DNA. -p. 16 -q
> Tolerance is not a Sapiens trademark. In modern times, a small ifference in skin colour, dialect or religion has been enough to prompt one group of Sapiens to set about exterminating another group. -p. 18 -q

> Sociological research has shown that maximum 'natural' size of a group bonded by gossip is about 150 individuals. Most people can neither intimately know, nore gossip effectively about, more than 150 human beings. -p. 17 -q
> How did Homo spiens manage to cross this critical threshold, eventually founding cities comprising tens of thousands of inhabitants and empires ruling hundreds of millions? The secret was probably the appearance of fiction. Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths. -p. 27 -q
> Peple easily understand that 'primitives' cement their social order by believing in ghosts and spirits, and gathering each full moon to dance together around the campfire. What we fail to appreciate is that our odern institutions function on exactly the same basis. -p. 28 -q
> According to the French legislators, if a certified lawyer followed all the proper litugy and rituals, wrote all the required spells ad oaths on a wonderfully decorated pience of paper, and affixed his ornate signature to the bottom of the document, then hocus pocus - a new company incorperated... Once the lawyer had performed all the right rituals and pronounced all the necessary spells and oaths, millions of upright French citizens behaved as if the Peugeot company really existed. -p. 31 -q

> There's hardly an activity, a belief, or even an emotion that is not mediated by objects of our own devising. -p. 43 -q
> Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, ther ehasn't been a single natural way of life for Sapiens. There are only cultural choices, from among a bewildering palette of possibilities. -p. 45 -q
> There was just one exception to this geeral rule: the dog. The dog was the first animal domesticated by Homo sapiens, and this occured before the Agricultural Revolution... Dogs were used for hunting and fighting, and as an alarm system against wild beasts and human intruders.... A 15,000-year bond has yielded a uch deeper understanding and affection between humans and dogs than between humans and any other animal. -p. 46 -q

> During the last million years, there has been an ice age on average of every 100,000 years. The last one ran from about 75,000 to 15,000 years ago.	66	q
> The second explanation is that by the time Sapiens reached Australia, they had already mastered fire agriculture. Faced with an alien and threatening environment, it seems that they deliberately burned vast areas of impassable thickets and dense forests to create open grasslands, which attracted more easily hunted game, and were better suited to their needs. They thereby completely changed the ecology of large parts of Australia within a few short millennia.	68	q
> ... hunting and fire agriculture...	68	q
> The first Americans arrived on foot, which they could do because, at the time, sa levels were low enough that a land bridge connected north-eastern Siberia with north-western Alaska.	69	q
> According to current estimates, within a short interval, North america lost thirty-four out of its forty-seven genera of large mammals.	71	q
> At the time of the Agricultral Revolution, only about a hundred[large terrestrial mammals] remained. Homo sapiens drove to extinction about half of the planet's big beasts long before humans invented the wheel, writing, or iron tools.	72	q

> At the time of their 'discovery,' the 'Indians' had no name by which they referred to themselves. Later they were called the Tainos, a term for Indians who spoke Arawak. The Tainos from the Bahamas Were called he Lucayas.

About 15,000 years ago... a small group of people camped on the sandy banks of a creek subsisted off game and especially lant foods. They lived in a cluser of near-rectangular huts...

> Hopewell people lived, for the most part, in small, isolated communities sometimes comprising no more than one or two exended families. -p. 208 -q
> This is a world of intimate kin relationships, where people from neighboring groups came together to harvest nuts and hunt, and for other activities... people learned and shared basic values, supernational beliefs, and rituals common to an entire society.

> On August 7, 1998, al-Qaeda launched simultaneous attacks on U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. -q -- Howland, an island in the pacific. -q -- Since 1945, U.S. armed forces have been deployed abroad for conflicts or potential conflicts 211 times in 67 countries. Call it peacekeeping if you want, or call it imperialism. But clearly this is not a country that has kept its hands to itself. -q -- They replaced colonization with globalization. ... It was also startling in how much it centered the world’s trade, transport, and communication on one country, the United States. -q -- It’s hard to know how many Indians inhabited North America before Europeans arrived. Five million for the area now covered by the contiguous United States, calculated by the anthropologist Russell Thornton, is a medium estimate... -q -- In the early years of the republic, their claims had been respected, roughly speaking. -q -- In 1828 the state of Georgia declared the Cherokee constitution invalid and demanded the Cherokees’ land. President Andrew Jackson approved. -q -- Thomas Jefferson had fantasized about dividing the entire country, with Native on one side and European on the other—hence his plan for the Louisiana Purchase. -q -- For the first few decades of the country’s history, this continental-scale apartheid had remained informal and incomplete. -q -- In the end, the thought of a “full-blood savage” with a desk in the Capitol proved too much for the delicate sensibilities of the members of the 23rd Congress. -q -- Guano Islands Act in 1856. -q -- four hundred thousand tons of rock guano off of U.S. appurtenances. That fell short of speculators... -q -- Fritz Haber, a German-Jewish chemist, developed a technique for synthesizing ammonia, -q -- In a delicious historical irony, the man who saved the world from starvation was also the father of weapons of mass destruction.-q -- After the war, Fritz continued his work, and his institute developed a promising insecticide called Zyklon A. In slightly modified form, under the name Zyklon B, it would be deployed on Fritz and Clara’s fellow Jews... -q -- Clara Immerwahr. Her cousin Max was my great-grandfather. -q -- The frontier, Turner argued, had been the great regenerating force in U.S. life—the source of democracy, individualism, practicality, and freedom. -q -- But Roosevelt had an uncanny knack for orchestrating events in his favor. -q -- Edmond Demolins’s book Anglo-Saxon -f -- As the Spanish governor-general explained, he was “willing to surrender to white people but never to Niggers.” -q -- Though the United States had rapidly annexed new territory, it had rarely incorporated large nonwhite populations. -q -- Combine a republican commitment to equality with an accompanying commitment to white supremacy, and this is what you got: a rapidly expanding empire of settlers that fed on land but avoided incorporating people. Uninhabited guano islands—those were fine. But all of Mexico or Nicaragua? No. -q -- Not taking land and flooding it with settlers, but conquering subject populations and ruling them. -q -- Republicanism, white supremacy, and overseas expansion ... -q -- The inalienable rights of man and the injustice of taxation without representation—these were bedrock political values. -q -- Twain’s British counterpart, Rudyard Kipling. -f -- As was often the case in the nineteenth century, most victims of the war died from disease. -q -- Massacres like this weren’t unknown in the United States. Wounded Knee, Sand Creek, Bloody Island—the Indian wars had painted the West red. Yet Bud Dajo dwarfed them all. -q -- Instead, Roosevelt’s government encouraged Panamanian nationalists to secede from Colombia, and then he negotiated for a small zone in which to build the canal. -q -- Looking Backward (1888) by Edward Bellamy. Read this -r -- Bellamy’s dream of efficiency, rationality, and hygiene -q -- “A man of brusque manners and few words” -q -- “Where tyranny is law, revolution is order,” Albizu declared. -q -- Ponce Massacure. -f -- Ever since Fritz Haber released chlorine gas at Ypres in 1915, the threat of chemical warfare had hung in the air. -q -- The colonies had their uses: as naval bases and zones of experimentation for men such as Daniel Burnham and Cornelius Rhoads. But colonial products weren’t integral to the U.S. economy. -q -- Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) -f -- Aleut internment. -f -- In May 1942 some 112,000 residents of western states, some Japanese nationals and some U.S. citizens of Japanese ancestry, were forcibly removed from their homes and held in camps for years. -q -- And despite the millions the military was pouring into the Alaska Highway, it never found the money to fix the internment camps. -q -- At least, the government was comfortable taking the men of the Pribilof Islands back to their homes to work the 1943 seal harvest (the Fish and Wildlife Service had a lucrative deal with a fur company). -q But in Alaskan camps, by the war’s end, 10 percent had died. -q -- The 150 tons of silver pesos, too bulky to move, were dumped into a secret spot in Manila Bay—a tantalizing challenge for future treasure hunters. -q -- “ABCD encirclement” (American-British-Chinese-Dutch), and it [the philippines]  meant that Japan’s access to oil, rubber, tin, and even food depended on foreign markets. -q -- Minella, The sixth-largest city in the United States—substantially larger than Boston or Washington, D.C. -q -- The Second World War in the Philippines rarely appears in history textbooks. But it should. It was by far the most destructive event ever to take place on U.S. soil. -q -- Ww2 death tolde: fifty-five million living humans -f -- There were only three things wrong with the GIs, the British quip went. They were “overpaid, over-sexed, and over here.” -q -- In late 1945, counting the occupations, 51 percent of the population of the Greater United States lived outside the states. But by 1960, after Hawai‘i and Alaska entered the union, that number had fallen to around 2 percent... -q -- In 1940 nearly one out of every three individuals on the planet was colonized. By 1965, it was down to one in fifty. -q -- shrinking the army from more than 8 million troops in May 1945 to fewer than 1 million by the end of June 1947 -q -- the United States was letting its largest colony go. And it was doing this, remarkably, so as not to look bad in the eyes of Asians. -q -- “intense, fanatical nationalism” -q -- Howard Zinn’s A People’s History of the United States and James Loewen’s Lies My Teacher told me.. Read these.. -q -- Cecil Rhodes -f -- powerful countries project their influence through globalization rather than colonization. -q -- The first plastic, celluloid, was devised to replace ivory in billiard balls -q -- As plexiglass, it could be the cockpit window of a plane. As cellophane, it could replace a tin can in food storage. Mixed with wood fiber as plywood, plastic could substitute for timber and steel in small boats, making them lighter, faster, and cheaper. Mixed with glass as fiberglass, it could be used to make planes. -q -- This was the legacy of the Second World War. Take the world’s most advanced economy, cut it off from most tropical trade, and send it into overdrive—it was the perfect recipe for a synthetic revolution. -q -- At no point in the twentieth century was there a serious possibility that oil would actually run out. Today, with new technologies enabling the exploitation of Canadian tar sands and the partial substitution of natural gas for oil, that danger seems as remote as ever. -q -- snafu. As in, Situation Normal: All Fucked Up. -q -- Aviation, knocked-down shipping, wireless communication, cryptography, chloroquine, DDT, and world-proofing. -q -- Herbert Hoover, as a man, can best be understood as the opposite of Teddy Roosevelt. -q -- But the mere act of the government calling an all-industry convention was often enough to secure agreement. -q -- By the war’s end, the United States had produced 84,000 tanks, 2.2 million trucks, 6.2 million rifles, and 41 billion rounds of small ammunition. The war against Hitler may have been a European fight, but it was very much made in the SA. -q -- Peace and prosperity called for global unification. -q -- Synthetics diminished the great powers’ need for strategic raw materials by offering substitutes. -q -- “psychological violence of the classroom” -q -- The most powerful force for anglicization has been the internet. -q -- Estimates vary widely, but it seems that roughly one in four humans on the planet can now speak it. -q -- The Swans were in the first batch of guano islands the United States had claimed. -q -- Yet Bin Laden’s motives were neither unknowable nor obscure. -q -- September 11 was, in large part, retaliation against the United States for its empire of bases. -q -- Bin Laden got lucky with George W. Bush, who had recently succeeded Bill Clinton. Bush could have treated the 9/11 attacks as a crime, arrested the perpetrators, and brought them to justice. Instead, he declared a “war on terror” of global expanse and promised to “rid the world of evil-doers.” -q -- “We need to create a colonial office—fast,” wrote Max Boot -- Foreign prisons, walled compounds, hidden bases, island colonies, GPS antenna stations, pinpoint strikes, networks, planes, and drones—these are the locales and instruments of the ongoing war on terror. This is the shape of power today. This is the world the United States has made. -q -- There are about four million people living in the territories today, in Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Northern Marianas.

Black articians had repeatedly led revolts to overturn slavery...

> The story begins with Atrus living with his grandmother; helping her around her estate, and learning about the world. Then his father Ghen comes to take him away to the age of D'ni. Here, the father teaches the son the art of writing. Atrus quickly excels, so quickly that he is able to see fatal flaws in the way that his father writes. After many disagreements, Ghen locks him away. But Ghen's fiance Catherine helps rescues Atrus. The story ends with Catherine and Atrus creating their own age to live in. I would recommend this to one who enjoys fantasy, books, and parent/child relationships.

Their names, in Newspeak: Minitrue, Minipax, Miniluv, and Miniplenty... -q -- Emmanuel Goldstein, the Enemy of the People -f -- "freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, freedom of thought" correspondences to the ministries. -- The Brotherhood, its name was supposed to be. -q  -- To dissemble your feelings, to control your face, to do what everyone else was doing, was an instinctive reaction. -q -- To dissemble your feelings, to control your face, to do what everyone else was doing, was an instinctive reaction. -q -- Oceania was at war with Eurasia and in alliance with Eastasia. -q -- If the Party could thrust its hand into the past and say of this or that event, it never happened -q -- “Who controls the past,” ran the Party slogan, “controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.” -q -- Ingsoc before 1960, but it was possible that in its Oldspeak form—“English Socialism,” -q -- Statistics were just as much a fantasy in their original version as in their rectified version. -q -- ... reconstruct the past... -q -- Floating Fortresses. -f -- More commonly, people who had incurred the displeasure of the Party simply disappeared and were never heard of again. -q -- ... and went on: “Don’t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? -q -- The Revolution will be complete when the language is perfect. -q -- Orthodoxy means not thinking—not needing to think. Orthodoxy is unconsciousness.” -q -- There was something that he lacked: discretion, aloofness, a sort of saving stupidity. -q -- Zeal was not enough. Orthodoxy was unconsciousness. -q -- The past was erased, the erasure was forgotten, the lie became truth. -q -- He wondered, as he had many times wondered before, whether he himself was a lunatic. Perhaps a lunatic was simply a minority of one. -q -- ... persuading you, almost, to deny the evidence of your senses. In the end the Party would announce that two and two made five, and you would have to believe it. -q -- The heresy of heresies was common sense. -q -- The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. -q -- It was assumed that when he was not working, eating, or sleeping he would be taking part in some kind of communal recreations; to do anything that suggested a taste for solitude, even to go for a walk by yourself, was always slightly dangerous. There was a word for it in Newspeak: ownlife, it was called, meaning individualism and eccentricity. -q -- stationer’s shop, WOTD -f -- rectification, WOTD -f -- cult of strenuousness and self-denial -q -- If you kept the small rules, you could break the big ones. -q -- It was not merely that the sex instinct created a world of its own which was outside the Party’s control and which therefore had to be destroyed if possible. -q -- She knew when to cheer and when to boo, and that was all one needed. -q -- ... beastly little swine... -q -- The terrible thing that the Party had done was to persuade you that mere impulses, mere feelings, were of no account, while at the same time robbing you of all power over the material world. -q -- They were not loyal to a party or a country or an idea, they were loyal to one another. -q -- Gelatinous, WOTD -f -- The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labor. -q -- The two aims of the Party are to conquer the whole surface of the earth and to extinguish once and for all the possibility of independent thought. -q -- Everywhere there is the same pyramidal structure, the same worship of semi-divine leader, the same economy existing by and for continuous warfare. -q -- Ingsoc in Oceania, Neo-Bolshevism in Eurasia, Death-worship, as it is commonly called, in Eastasia... -q -- The so-called “abolition of private property” which took place in the middle years of the century meant, in effect, the concentration of property in far fewer hands than before; but with this difference, that the new owners were a group instead of a mass of individuals. -q -- Doublethink lies at the very heart of Ingsoc.. -q -- To tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget any fact that has become inconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary again, to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed, to deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one denies—all this is indispensably necessary. -q -- For the secret of rulership is to combine a belief in one’s own infallibility with the power to learn from past mistakes. -q -- The Ministry of Peace concerns itself with war, the Ministry of Truth with lies, the Ministry of Love with torture, and the Ministry of Plenty with starvation. -q -- Chapter 1, like Chapter 3, had not actually told him anything that he did not know; it had merely systematized the knowledge that he possessed already. -q -- behind the chimney pots into interminable distances. It was curious to think that the sky was the same for everybody, in Eurasia or Eastasia as well as here. And the people under the sky were also very much the same—everywhere... -q -- Who controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the past,’” -q -- You would not make the act of submission which is the price of sanity. You preferred to be a lunatic, a minority of one. -q -- The Party is not interested in the overt act; the thought is all we care about. -q -- THERE ARE THREE STAGES in your reintegration,” said O’Brien. “There is learning, there is understanding, and there is acceptance. It is time for you to enter upon the second stage.” -q -- “How does one man assert his power over another, Winston?” Winston thought. “By making him suffer,” he said. -q -- He was not bored; he had no desire for conversation or distraction. Merely to be alone, not to be beaten or questioned, to have enough to eat, and to be clean all over, was completely satisfying. -q -- Stupidity was as necessary as intelligence, and as difficult to attain. -q -- The thing that is in Room 101 is the worst thing in the world. -q
