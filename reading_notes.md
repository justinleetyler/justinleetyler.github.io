> Ideology makes people feel that their leader is godlike, and thus someone they want to support. While the king is busy bing king - issuing orders, activing as religious leader, and working with his advisors - it falls to the elite to construct propaganda campaigns. Because the king can pit those spin masters against one another, using the tactic of dividing and conquering, they will ump all over each other as they compete to out-sycophant each other.  In fact, all of those images of the king as god, all of those texts written aboutt he martial feats of the monarch, are made by men trying to show more loyalty than the other guy, men trying to accumulate more power, more money, more access. Many texts about royal power show how these wealthy men often make mistakes that hte king has to fixcreating the opportunity for courtiers to doubt and accuse one another of not being loyal enough. Everyone is finger-pointing, while few point up the ladder at the king himself. The gaslighters become the gaslit. -p. 45 -q -- .. our mercenary soldiers from sacrificial victims for an imperial cult? -p. 47 -q -- The truth is, propaganda is not some evil dude pulling the strings and manipulating all of us. It's a collection of created narratives that gaslight and divert attention, that reframe and perfect, that justify what might b emade considered bad or immoral behavior by turning it into policymaking, ideologizing it, cleaning it up. -p. 48 -q -- Whether a millionaire, movie star, president, CEO, YouTube star, or just the most popular and powerful person we know, we love to name-drop and associate ourselves wit hthat outsized source of influence. Social size matters, and the human mammal loves to organize is collective power pyramidically. -p. 66 -q -- In ancient Egypt, with each new family lineage, there was the expectation of a new miracle to prove that the king really was a god. -p. 82 -q -- But just as Reagan's ideological power is still very much with us today, our own Great Pyramid whose shadow still falls across the landscape. It has ended up empowering the very men who created that prosperity gospel of narcissistic individualism, weakening government itself over time and creating political polarization so great that it resulted in a semi-authoritarian corporate regime unwilling to fight a global pandemic for the common good. In the longer term, it has been those Reagan supporters who have benefited as they gutted the middle class, deregulated businesses such as banks, dismantled social servies, and became the nation's top 2 percent. -p. 84 -q -- When we remove our leders from their baser tasks, fabrication god-like kings and shielding them from what is really happening in teh trenches, they become emasculated... THey were all too busy living in Reagan's Shining City on a Hill, acting the role of eminent leader and rallying supporters and troops while their empowered elites were busy doing the real work, and grifting the whole time. -p. 85 -q -- Think of today's megconstrcutions -- monster coroporations such as Amazon, Apple, J P Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Microsoft, and Boeing... whose machinations drive local businesses into extinction... what is the endgame of all these megaconstructions? Well, in ancient Egypt, the late 6th-dynasy state had not only become too large that it ws nonfuctional (think of the giant cable company that never answers the phone), it had also become a mass of intercompeting elites who used the government to serve no one but themselves. (Think of today's relentless multimillion-dollar bonuses, payoffs, bribes, insider trading, adn fraud, all happening openly with on one gong to prison.) -p. 98 -q -- The Egyptian pyramid is a cautionary example. It was used as an ideological weapon to tranform some people into gods -- but it also tore society apart from the inside out. -p. 99 -q

Hain seems to take great pride in actually not taking advice from the civil service, and forcing his will upon officials and departments. This is viewed as true leadership. He also shows distress when the press digs into the politics of a story rather than the story. One wonders what the press is to do. While saying that the press doesn't pay attention to serious, intelligent information and true debate. Yet when they do, Hain says they become part of the story.
